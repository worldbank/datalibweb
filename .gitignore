# We recommend that you create a .gitignore file using GitHub's tools and
# replace the content of that file with the content of this file. Otherwise
# you have to rename this file .gitignore. But if you rename the fine in a
# regular folder window PCs and Macs are likely to keep the file extension
# so that the file ends up being names .gitignore.txt. Code editors like, Atom,
# can edit the file extension, but if you are not familiar with how to do that,
# we recommend that you generate an ignore file using GitHub and simply replace
# the content of that file.
#
# Note that if you are using GitKraken you need to use version 5.x or more
# recent for this template to work properly

# Start by ignoring everything, and below we are explicitly saying

#######################
# List of files with GitHub functionality anywhere in the repo
# that we do not want to ignore

# These files include GitHub settings
!.gitignore
!.gitattributes

# Keep markdown files used for documentation on GitHub
!README.md
!CONTRIBUTING.md
!LICENSE.md

#######################
# For performance reasons, if a folder is already ignored, then
# GitHub does not check the content for that folder for matches
# with additional rules. The line below includes folder in the
# top folder (but not their content), so that anything matching
# the rules below will still not be ignored.
