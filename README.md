# **datalibweb** - frontend for a Stata API for World Bank microdata

## Description

**datalibweb** is the Stata frontend for the microdata API created by Poverty Global Practice in collaboration with ITS and DECDG to enable users to access data and documentation available in different global, regional and country microdata catalogs at the World Bank. Currently there is data from the _Poverty GP_, _Health GP_ and the _Social Protection and Jobs GP_.

**datalibweb** is an API data platform specifically designed to enable users to access the most up-to-date data and documentation available in different regions catalogs at the World Bank. It allows users to access the latest and historical versions of non-harmonized (original/raw) data as well as different harmonized collections across across Global Practices. It is integrated with Stata through the **datalibweb** Stata package.

## Installation
**datalibweb** is currently only availible on World Bank computers, and there is no installation needed as **datalibweb** is already installed on all World Bank computers that have Stata installed. Run `datalibweb` in your installation of Stata to test that it is really installed.

## Disclaimer

 **datalibweb** is developed to facilitate the access of the ex-post
harmonization and not-harmonized (original or raw) data produced and gathered by the regional teams in the Poverty Global Practice.
Please use with **CAUTION** and please remember to follow the
**datalibweb**'s [TERMS OF USE](#terms_use)!!

Access to the harmonized or original dataset is not given to users automatically unless the dataset is marked with Public access. 
Users need to contact regional/collection focal points and ask for the permission. Each user will have different sets of subscription to the survey. 
At the minimum, users will be able to query the meta data of the survey. 

 Users are expected to conduct their own due diligence before implementing any analysis using this harmonized datasets. Please notice
that not all survey years within specific countries are necessarily comparable due to changes in survey design and questionnaire.
For further information regarding the metadata of the each original survey used in this harmonization and to access any supporting
documentation, please visit the [Microdata Library intranet site](http://microdatalib.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/eca).
For information on how to upload or download data from the Microdata library, click [here](\\Ecafile\eca-special\ECA_Databank\datalib\_doc\ECADATAPORTAL_Guidelines_1page.pdf).

 Users are expected to check summary statistics and published critical indicators computed with this microdata such as: poverty, inequality, and/or 
shared prosperity numbers in the regional data lab sites in [Poverty Global Practice intranet site](http://globalpractices.worldbank.org/poverty/Pages/en/GPGHome.aspx)
before conducting any analysis. 

 Users are encouraged to take note of the vintage of the harmonization that is being used in order to assure future 
replicability of results. Please notice that this application will also retrieve by default the latest version of the harmonization, 
and this might change over time. For more information please read the help file, including on how to retrieve previous 
vintages.
