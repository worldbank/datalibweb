{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd: datalibweb} Datalibweb is an API data platform specifically designed to enable users to access 
 the most up-to-date data and documentation available in different regional catalogs 
 at the World Bank. It allows users to access the latest and historical versions of
 non-harmonized (original/raw) data as well as different harmonized collections across
 across Global Practices. It is integrated with Stata through the Datalibweb Stata package. The commands also allows to extract different modules if available.  In 
addition {cmd: datalibweb} generates time-deflated variables, poverty lines, (LCU equivalent to 2005 or  2011 PPP US$) and the conversion factors used. Prospective 
users must ask access to: {browse "mailto: datalibweb@worldbank.org":datalibweb@worldbank.org}

{pstd}
{cmd: datalibweb} or {cmd: dlw} is a data system developed by the Global Team for Statistical Development, Poverty and Equity GP, of the World Bank in collobration with the ECA IT and QuickStrike teams in the ITS group. {p_end}

{pstd}
Alternatively, -{cmd:datalibweb}- provides the user with another level of interactivity with Graphical User Interface and in Stata. It is possible type {cmd:datalibweb} on the Stata command window to see an interactive screen 
that allows users to find available surveys in the datalib system. Users will have to follow a dynamic tree selecting first the desired region, then the country, and finally the 
collection to see all available harmonized and raw survey dataset. Users can use {cmd:datalibweb} or {cmd:dlw} interchangeably.

{synoptset 27 tabbed}{...}
{synopthdr:Required}
{synoptline}
{synopt:{opt coun:try(string)}}three digits country code (WDI standards). More than one country is allowed, i.e "ALB VNM". {p_end}

{synopt:{opt y:ears(numlist)}}years for which the data is requested (one or many years: i.e. 2005 or 2005/2008 or 2005 2008).{p_end}

{synopt:{opt t:ype(string)}}type of ONE collection requested. Currently the only COLLECTIONS available are: {it:eappov}, {it:ecapov}, {it:ecaraw}, {it:eu-lfs}, {it:udb-c} or {it:eusilc}, {it:udb-l} (panel eusilc), {it:mnapov}, {it:mnaraw}, {it:sarmd}, {it:ssapov}, {it:gmd}, {it:sarraw}, {it:eapraw}, {it:ssaraw}, {it:sedlac}, {it:lablac}, {it:conlac} and many more. {p_end}

{marker PPP}{...}
{dlgtab:PPP Conversion}

{synopt:{opt ppp:(numlist)}}allows to select between 2005 and/or 2011 as the PPP deflation factor in the corresponding CPI/PPP database. It is used in combination with {cmd:plppp()} and/or {cmd:incppp()} options.{p_end}
		
{synopt:{opt pl:ppp(numlist)}}allows to create local currency unit (LCU) poverty lines equivalent to international dollars. Conversion 
        is done by using 2011/2005 PPP with corresponding 2011/2005 CPI values. The user has to enter a list of numbers
		with the poverty lines (in 2005/2011 dollars). If the poverty line is a fractional number 
		(i.e. 1.9 or 3.1), {cmd: datalibweb} will create a variable using the value entered as part of the variable name. For 
		instance, if the user puts the 1.9 dollar a day poverty line, the variable name created will be 
		“lp_1_9usd_2005” or “lp_1_9usd_2011” depending on the PPP year specified in the {cmd:ppp()} option because Stata does not allow to use “.” as part of variable names. It is used in combination with the {cmd:ppp()} option.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt inc:ppp(varlist)}}converts variables (in nominal LCU) in the {it:varlist} to PPP-based variables, expressed in 2005 and/or 2011 PPP US$ as defined in the {cmd:ppp()} option. It is useful to convert income/consumption aggregates for across years/countries comparisons and international poverty and shared prosperity indicators.
		This option creates new variables with the same name as the original, plus the suffix either _2005 or _2011. {p_end}
		
{synopt:{opt nocpi}}opens the requested dataset without including any cpi and ppp variables. {p_end}		
		
		
{dlgtab: Specific files or Modules}

{synopt:{opt filen:ame(string)}}indicates the file to be opened. {p_end}

{synopt:{opt surveyid(string)}}uses the unique Survey ID to access that specific data. For example, the Survey ID could be ALB_2012_LSMS_v01_M_v04_A_ECAPOV for harmonized data or ALB_2012_LSMS_v01_M for raw/original data.{p_end}

{pstd} This feature can bring the Explore-view for all the data in the system. User can access it by clicking to the Datalibweb menu on the top-left corner in the Stata application. 
There are two views: by country and by server. Country views list all the raw and harmonzied data for that country across the different servers. Server views list all harmonized data 
under that collection. View can also be filtered by "Latest version" and/or "Subscribed to". This feature works for Stata 14 and earier versions, it might not work as expected in Stata 15 and 16.
